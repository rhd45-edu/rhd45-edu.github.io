# Places to Travel 
I feel that everyone should travel the world at least once in their life. There is so much to the world that we do not know. Below are a few places I would like to visit and why: 
- [*Italy*](#italy)
- [*Japan*](#japan)
- [*France*](#france)
- [*China*](#china)

# Italy
I want to visit Italy because of its culture and scenery. I have recently looked into study abroad with the College of Engineering! The view of the ocean looks amazing! It is something I could not experience here in the states. I am also curious about the culture in Italy. I think it would be a blast to experience it.

# Japan
I want to visit Japan due to the culture and cuisine. Japanese Culture is quite different from American culture. It would be fun to experience that culture. Also, I love ramen! :) I would be so happy if I could try a bowl of **authentic** Japanese Ramen in Japan!

# France
I want to visit France due to the culture and cuisine. I enjoy cooking different types of foods with different methods. France is known to have quite the cuisine. One of my goals is to taste a **french croissant**.

# China
I want to visit China because of its extensive history and culture. China is one of the oldest countries in the world. I believe it would be beneficial to experience the culture of a nation that has been through much over its history that spans thousands of years.
