# Education
When I was younger, I was fascinated how computers were transforming the world. I wanted to learn more about computers and play a role in the development of future technology. After looking more into different majors, I decided to study Information Technology.

While in college, I have had the chance to learn different programming languages. Below is my solution for a programming challenge that I had in python: 
    
    initial_position = float(input("Please enter the object's initial position as a float: "));
    initial_velocity = float(input("Please enter the object's initial velocity as a float: "));
    object_acceleration = float(input("Please enter the object's acceleration as a float: "));
    object_travel_time = float(input("Please enter the object's travel time as a float: "));
    
    final_position = (initial_position + (initial_velocity * object_travel_time) 
    + ( 0.5 * object_acceleration * object_travel_time * object_travel_time));
    
    print("The final position of the object is " + str(final_position) + " meters.");
