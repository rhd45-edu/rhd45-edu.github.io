# Why Mizzou?

I chose Mizzou for its Engineering program and its values. The College of Engineering has a variety of engineering disciplines that allow for inter-disciplinary studies and work. To me, it is important for everyone to respect one another, take responsibility for our own actions, discover solutions for current and future problems, and commit to standards of excellence. Looking back on when I was deciding to choose a college, I am glad that I chose Mizzou!
